## Project Description

This page will showcase my abilities and work as a developer. It will be made up of a navigation/header bar that links to all content on the page, descending down the page it will list an about me section, a projects section of completed projects I developed, a skills section to showcase what languages I know as well as other programs and software I utilize as a developer, aresume tab that will link my CV as well as links to my Social Media (Linkedin, Github, and maybe Instagram), then finally a contact footer that will allow people to leave me a message and provide my contact information.

Time is limited and I would love to develop an amazing site with a plethora of awesome functionality features and designs, however my experience is limited and so is my time, so I have narrowed down my site to have two main functions and one central design in mind. I want to build a scroll toll so that as you scroll down the page, each section is centered on the screen and gently "snaps" into place and as you scroll again this gentle snap rolls you to the next item on the page. the second functionality I will build is a working contact page that does in fact send me messages via email when someone uses the site. Then finally I for design I want to use a cool neon glow effect for all my buttons and divs so that my page has a darker background color and when you navigate the page different glow and light up effects are triggerted.

## Wireframes

After my first draft of a wireframe I see that it will be very difficult to display my skills and projects entirely on the limited space of the mobile and tablet media sizes. To solve this issue I believe a slider tool will need to be built and added to the projects and skills mobile sections.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP (examples)

MVP
fully functioning Scroll focus feature
Fully functioning navigation and dropdown navigation
Fully Functioning Mobile/Tablet Slider bars

#### PostMVP 

Post MVP
Fully Functioning Contact forms
Neon Styling and Glow/Light up Functions

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into smaller components.  Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the portfolio. Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the portfolio must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

#### MVP
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | 
| Scroll Focus (2a, 2b) | H | 4hr | 6hr |
| Navigation (3a, 3b, 3c) | H | 6hr | 10hr |
| Mobile Slider Bars (4a, 4b) | H | 4hr | 6hr |  
| Total | H | 14hrs| 22hrs |

#### PostMVP
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | 
| Contact Forms Field (4a, 4b) | M | 4hr | 6hr |
| Neon Glow Styling (6a, 6b) | M | 4hr | 6hr |
| On Hover Neon Functionality | L | 2hr | 3hr |
| Image Files and Icons | L | 2hr | 3hr |
| Total | H | 12hrs| 18hrs |
