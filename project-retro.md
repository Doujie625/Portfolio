# Project Retrospective

Let’s take a few minutes as a class and capture as many insights possible in the categories below.  One of the instructional team will go through each category and capture as many thoughts as possible.  We ask that you come off mute and speak your thoughts out loud for everyone to hear. 

## Lessons Learned

What lessons did you learn during this project and how will you apply them towards the next project? 

- use your peers a support
- Plan section and use classed and id's efficiently
- Don't spend too much time on one thing without asking for help
- organization is key. Use separate css files for mobile/tablet/desktop
- A good and well thought-out design prior to coding helps a lot
- take breaks when necessary, trying to solve one problem for 4 hours straight, wont help you think clearly
- Keep good buffer for Responsive design as it takes more time than expected. 
- Keep taking git commits and push as often as possible just in case if we want to revert back
- Daily checklists! Really helped me keep track of what needed to be done
- Instructors want you to learn, so just be honest with your limitations and just ask.
- bootstrap is your friend and occasional enemy
- perfection is not worth the anxiety
- he M in MVP means minimum. Always check the project reqs and if you can add something to Post-MVP, do it. Fail fast
- Do your best to stick to your plan, including breaks, so you don't get burnt out or worse. Have good time management to a lot for work and the rest of your life.
- Make sure to always try to not feel distressed and hopeless, when not being able to solve the problem you have the resources to overcome that specific problem
- being more organized with html and css. Doing API first******.  Being organized in 
- Do not be too proud to ask for help
- If it is not working after certain period, come back to it later, change of perspective helps a lot
- Use VS Code split screen! That way when I made changes I didn’t have to keep jumping back between the two documents. This setup saved time, was more efficient.
- appreciating how much work websites require and the beauty of Joe's favorite website: NASA Mars.
- Stay true to your style. Don't try to create something that's not you. You're making a brand for yourself and your work should reflect your brand and your style.
- Don’t compare your project to others, everyone starts off as a beginner. You’re in this course to learn and gain experience.
- be sure to  define and focus on your top priorities for the day (be specific) — if your priority is getting the grid layout down, don’t get distracted in the middle of doing your grid and start styling sections if styling is not on your top priority list
- celebrate ALL the wins, no matter how small
- plan in buffer time not only to ask question and troubleshoot for your own issues, but also build in (or at least make time) to help others  - it helps us to help each other!
- plan in buffer time not only to ask question and troubleshoot for your own issues, but also build in (or at least make time) to help others  - it helps us to help each other!
- Watch all the youtube videos//subscribe to particularly helpful youtube channels, especially if you're a visual learner and just reading the documentation is hard to conceptualize
- Fail early in order to learn faster !!!
- learn to scrap and adapt from your original plan
- Comment your code!



## Problem Areas

What areas of the project did you struggle with most?

- most ppl had problems connecting their projects to google sheets
- styling/CSS
- not knowing what to research when I was stuck
- Getting the contact form to actually work
- sometimes it's easier to just code something yourself than mess with bootstrap

- styling and calling data from google sheets
- Bootstrap.... Flexbox.... Especially Flexbox...CSS Grid
- javascript syntax
- Pushing through the imposter syndrome
- Bootstrap affecting things on the page I didn't think it should affect
- Don't be afraid to try out something new but have buffer for it.
- Media queries and making effective use of the extra space on tablet/desktop without adding clutter
- Getting distracted with the post-mvp instead of focusing on the mvp
- I have  a lot of issues rendering my google sheet project data to the page since I used bootstrap for project cards and all the classes from bootstrap were really confusing
- Having a positive mindset when you're going through something so stressful and new to you.
- getting the hamburger to disappear after moving cursor off of it
- I found myself getting frustrated and skipping around making me less productive.
- settling on one idea
- Knowing what to work on next after completing a task
